Introduction
=============

The most basic features of galpy are its ability to display rotation
curves and perform orbit integration for arbitrary combinations of
potentials. This section introduce the most basic features of
``galpy.potential`` and ``galpy.orbit``.


.. _rotcurves:

Rotation curves
---------------

The following code example shows how to initialize a Miyamoto-Nagai disk potential and plot its rotation curve

>>> from galpy.potential import MiyamotoNagaiPotential
>>> mp= MiyamotoNagaiPotential(a=0.5,b=0.0375,normalize=1.)
>>> mp.plotRotcurve(Rrange=[0.01,10.],grid=1001)

The ``normalize=1.`` option normalizes the potential such that the
radial force is a fraction ``normalize=1.`` of the radial force
necessary to make the circular velocity 1 at R=1.

Similarly we can initialize other potentials and plot the combined
rotation curve

>>> from galpy.potential import NFWPotential, HernquistPotential
>>> mp= MiyamotoNagaiPotential(a=0.5,b=0.0375,normalize=.6)
>>> np= NFWPotential(a=4.5,normalize=.35)
>>> hp= HernquistPotential(a=0.6/8,normalize=0.05)
>>> from galpy.potential import plotRotcurve
>>> plotRotcurve([hp,mp,np],Rrange=[0.01,10.],grid=1001,yrange=[0.,1.2])

Note that the ``normalize`` values add up to 1. such that the circular
velocity will be 1 at R=1. The resulting rotation curve is
approximately flat. To show the rotation curves of the three
components do

>>> mp.plotRotcurve(Rrange=[0.01,10.],grid=1001,overplot=True)
>>> hp.plotRotcurve(Rrange=[0.01,10.],grid=1001,overplot=True)
>>> np.plotRotcurve(Rrange=[0.01,10.],grid=1001,overplot=True)

You'll see the following

.. image:: images/rotcurve.png

As a shortcut the ``[hp,mp,np]`` Milky-Way-like potential is defined as

>>> from galpy.potential import MWPotential

This is *not* the recommended Milky-Way-like potential in
``galpy``. The (currently) recommended Milky-Way-like potential is
``MWPotential2014``:

>>> from galpy.potential import MWPotential2014

``MWPotential2014`` has a more realistic bulge model and is actually
fit to various dynamical constraints on the Milky Way (see
:ref:`here <potential-mw>` and the ``galpy`` paper). 

Units in galpy
--------------
.. _units:

Above we normalized the potentials such that they give a circular
velocity of 1 at R=1. These are the standard galpy units (sometimes
referred to as *natural units* in the documentation). galpy will work
most robustly when using these natural units. When using galpy to
model a real galaxy with, say, a circular velocity of 220 km/s at R=8
kpc, all of the velocities should be scaled as v= V/[220 km/s] and all
of the positions should be scaled as x = X/[8 kpc] when using galpy's
natural units.

For convenience, a utility module ``bovy_conversion`` is included in
galpy that helps in converting between physical units and natural
units for various quantities. For example, in natural units the
orbital time of a circular orbit at R=1 is :math:`2\pi`; in
physical units this corresponds to

>>> from galpy.util import bovy_conversion
>>> print 2.*numpy.pi*bovy_conversion.time_in_Gyr(220.,8.)
0.223405444283

or about 223 Myr. We can also express forces in various physical
units. For example, for the Milky-Way-like potential defined in galpy,
we have that the vertical force at 1.1 kpc is

>>> from galpy.potential import MWPotential2014, evaluatezforces
>>> -evaluatezforces(1.,1.1/8.,MWPotential2014)*bovy_conversion.force_in_pcMyr2(220.,8.)
2.0259181908629933

which we can also express as an equivalent surface-density by dividing
by :math:`2\pi G`

>>> -evaluatezforces(1.,1.1/8.,MWPotential2014)*bovy_conversion.force_in_2piGmsolpc2(220.,8.)
71.658016957792356

Because the vertical force at the solar circle in the Milky Way at 1.1
kpc above the plane is approximately :math:`70\,(2\pi G\,
M_\odot\,\mathrm{pc}^{-2})` (e.g., `2013arXiv1309.0809B
<http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013arXiv1309.0809B>`_), this shows
that our Milky-Way-like potential has a realistic disk (at least in
this respect).

``bovy_conversion`` further has functions to convert densities,
masses, surface densities, and frequencies to physical units (actions
are considered to be too obvious to be included); see :ref:`here
<bovyconversion>` for a full list. As a final example, the local dark
matter density in the Milky-Way-like potential is given by

>>> MWPotential2014[2].dens(1.,0.)*bovy_conversion.dens_in_msolpc3(220.,8.)
0.0075419566970079373

or

>>> MWPotential2014[2].dens(1.,0.)*bovy_conversion.dens_in_gevcc(220.,8.)
0.28643101789044584

or about :math:`0.0075\,M_\odot\,\mathrm{pc}^{-3} \approx
0.3\,\mathrm{GeV\,cm}^{-3}`, in line with current measurements (e.g.,
`2012ApJ...756...89B
<http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012ApJ...756...89B>`_).

When ``galpy`` Orbits are initialized using a distance scale ``ro=``
and a velocity scale ``vo=`` output quantities returned and plotted in
physical coordinates. Specifically, positions are are returned in
units of kpc, velocities in km/s, energies and the Jacobi integral in
(km/s)^2, the angular momentum o.L() and actions in km/s kpc,
frequencies in 1/Gyr, and times and periods in Gyr.

Orbit integration
-----------------

We can also integrate orbits in all galpy potentials. Going back to a
simple Miyamoto-Nagai potential, we initialize an orbit as follows

>>> from galpy.orbit import Orbit
>>> mp= MiyamotoNagaiPotential(a=0.5,b=0.0375,amp=1.,normalize=1.)
>>> o= Orbit(vxvv=[1.,0.1,1.1,0.,0.1])

Since we gave ``Orbit()`` a five-dimensional initial condition
``[R,vR,vT,z,vz]``, we assume we are dealing with a three-dimensional
axisymmetric potential in which we do not wish to track the
azimuth. We then integrate the orbit for a set of times ``ts``

>>> import numpy
>>> ts= numpy.linspace(0,100,10000)
>>> o.integrate(ts,mp,method='odeint')

Now we plot the resulting orbit as

>>> o.plot()

Which gives

.. image:: images/mp-orbit-integration.png

The integrator used is not symplectic, so the energy error grows with time, but is small nonetheless

>>> o.plotE(normed=True)

.. image:: images/mp-orbit-E.png

When we use a symplectic leapfrog integrator, we see that the energy
error remains constant

>>> o.integrate(ts,mp,method='leapfrog')
>>> o.plotE(xlabel=r'$t$',ylabel=r'$E(t)/E(0)$')

.. image:: images/mp-orbit-Esymp.png

Because stars have typically only orbited the center of their galaxy
tens of times, using symplectic integrators is mostly unnecessary
(compared to planetary systems which orbits millions or billions of
times). galpy contains fast integrators written in C, which can be
accessed through the ``method=`` keyword (e.g.,
``integrate(...,method='dopr54_c')`` is a fast high-order
Dormand-Prince method).

When we integrate for much longer we see how the orbit fills up a
torus (this could take a minute)

>>> ts= numpy.linspace(0,1000,10000)
>>> o.integrate(ts,mp,method='odeint')
>>> o.plot()

.. image:: images/mp-long-orbit-integration.png

As before, we can also integrate orbits in combinations of potentials. Assuming ``mp, np,`` and ``hp`` were defined as above, we can

>>> ts= numpy.linspace(0,100,10000)
>>> o.integrate(ts,[mp,hp,np])
>>> o.plot()

.. image:: images/mphpnp-orbit-integration.png

Energy is again approximately conserved

>>> o.plotE(xlabel=r'$t$',ylabel=r'$E(t)/E(0)$')

Escape velocity curves
----------------------

Just like we can plot the rotation curve for a potential or a
combination of potentials, we can plot the escape velocity curve. For
example, the escape velocity curve for the Miyamoto-Nagai disk defined
above

>>> mp.plotEscapecurve(Rrange=[0.01,10.],grid=1001)

.. image:: images/esc-miyamoto.png

or of the combination of potentials defined above

>>> from galpy.potential import plotEscapecurve
>>> plotEscapecurve([mp,hp,np],Rrange=[0.01,10.],grid=1001)

.. image:: images/esc-comb.png

For the Milky-Way-like potential ``MWPotential2014``, the
escape-velocity curve is

>>> plotEscapecurve(MWPotential2014,Rrange=[0.01,10.],grid=1001)

.. image:: images/esc-mw14.png

At the solar radius, the escape velocity is

>>> from galpy.potential import vesc
>>> vesc(MWPotential2014,1.)
2.3316389848832784

Or, for a local circular velocity of 220 km/s

>>> vesc(MWPotential2014,1.)*220.
512.96057667432126

similar to direct measurements of this (e.g., `2007MNRAS.379..755S
<http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007MNRAS.379..755S>`_ and
`2014A%26A...562A..91P
<http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014A%26A...562A..91P>`_).
