Potentials in galpy
====================

galpy contains a large variety of potentials in ``galpy.potential``
that can be used for orbit integration, the calculation of
action-angle coordinates, as part of steady-state distribution
functions, and to study the properties of gravitational
potentials. This section introduces some of these features.

Potentials and forces
----------------------

Various 3D and 2D potentials are contained in galpy, list in the
:ref:`API page <potential-api>`. Another way to list the latest overview
of potentials included with galpy is to run

>>> import galpy.potential
>>> print [p for p in dir(galpy.potential) if 'Potential' in p]
['CosmphiDiskPotential',
 'DehnenBarPotential',
 'DoubleExponentialDiskPotential',
 'EllipticalDiskPotential',
 'FlattenedPowerPotential',
 'HernquistPotential',
....]

(list cut here for brevity). Section :ref:`Rotation curves
<rotcurves>` explains how to initialize potentials and how to display
the rotation curve of single Potential instances or of combinations of
such instances. Similarly, we can evaluate a Potential instance

>>> from galpy.potential import MiyamotoNagaiPotential
>>> mp= MiyamotoNagaiPotential(a=0.5,b=0.0375,normalize=1.)
>>> mp(1.,0.)
-1.2889062500000001

Most member functions of Potential instances have corresponding
functions in the galpy.potential module that allow them to be
evaluated for lists of multiple Potential
instances. ``galpy.potential.MWPotential2014`` is such a list of three
Potential instances

>>> from galpy.potential import MWPotential2014
>>> print MWPotential2014
[<galpy.potential_src.PowerSphericalPotentialwCutoff.PowerSphericalPotentialwCutoff instance at 0x1089b23b0>, <galpy.potential_src.MiyamotoNagaiPotential.MiyamotoNagaiPotential instance at 0x1089b2320>, <galpy.potential_src.TwoPowerSphericalPotential.NFWPotential instance at 0x1089b2248>]

and we can evaluate the potential by using the ``evaluatePotentials``
function

>>> from galpy.potential import evaluatePotentials
>>> evaluatePotentials(1.,0.,MWPotential2014)
-1.3733506513947895

We can plot the potential of axisymmetric potentials (or of
non-axisymmetric potentials at phi=0) using the ``plot`` member
function

>>> mp.plot()

which produces the following plot

.. image:: images/mp-potential.png

Similarly, we can plot combinations of Potentials using
``plotPotentials``, e.g., 

>>> from galpy.potential import plotPotentials
>>> plotPotentials(MWPotential2014,rmin=0.01)

.. image:: images/MWPotential-potential.png

These functions have arguments that can provide custom ``R`` and ``z``
ranges for the plot, the number of grid points, the number of
contours, and many other parameters determining the appearance of
these figures.

galpy also allows the forces corresponding to a gravitational
potential to be calculated. Again for the Miyamoto-Nagai Potential
instance from above

>>> mp.Rforce(1.,0.)
-1.0

This value of -1.0 is due to the normalization of the potential such
that the circular velocity is 1. at R=1. Similarly, the vertical force
is zero in the mid-plane

>>> mp.zforce(1.,0.)
-0.0

but not further from the mid-plane

>>> mp.zforce(1.,0.125)
-0.53488743705310848

As explained in :ref:`Units in galpy <units>`, these forces are in
standard galpy units, and we can convert them to physical units using
methods in the ``galpy.util.bovy_conversion`` module. For example,
assuming a physical circular velocity of 220 km/s at R=8 kpc

>>> from galpy.util import bovy_conversion
>>> mp.zforce(1.,0.125)*bovy_conversion.force_in_kmsMyr(220.,8.)
-3.3095671288657584 #km/s/Myr
>>> mp.zforce(1.,0.125)*bovy_conversion.force_in_2piGmsolpc2(220.,8.)
-119.72021771473301 #2 \pi G Msol / pc^2

Again, there are functions in ``galpy.potential`` that allow for the
evaluation of the forces for lists of Potential instances, such that

>>> from galpy.potential import evaluateRforces
>>> evaluateRforces(1.,0.,MWPotential2014)
-1.0
>>> from galpy.potential import evaluatezforces
>>> evaluatezforces(1.,0.125,MWPotential2014)*bovy_conversion.force_in_2piGmsolpc2(220.,8.)
>>> -69.680720137571114 #2 \pi G Msol / pc^2

We can evaluate the flattening of the potential as
:math:`\sqrt{|z\,F_R/R\,F_Z|}` for a Potential instance as well as for
a list of such instances

>>> mp.flattening(1.,0.125)
0.4549542914935209
>>> from galpy.potential import flattening
>>> flattening(MWPotential2014,1.,0.125)
0.61231675305658628

Densities
---------

galpy can also calculate the densities corresponding to gravitational
potentials. For many potentials, the densities are explicitly
implemented, but if they are not, the density is calculated using the
Poisson equation (second derivatives of the potential have to be
implemented for this). For example, for the Miyamoto-Nagai potential,
the density is explicitly implemented

>>> mp.dens(1.,0.)
1.1145444383277576

and we can also calculate this using the Poisson equation

>>> mp.dens(1.,0.,forcepoisson=True)
1.1145444383277574

which are the same to machine precision

>>> mp.dens(1.,0.,forcepoisson=True)-mp.dens(1.,0.)
-2.2204460492503131e-16

Similarly, all of the potentials in ``galpy.potential.MWPotential2014``
have explicitly-implemented densities, so we can do

>>> from galpy.potential import evaluateDensities
>>> evaluateDensities(1.,0.,MWPotential2014)
0.57508603122264867

In physical coordinates, this becomes

>>> evaluateDensities(1.,0.,MWPotential2014)*bovy_conversion.dens_in_msolpc3(220.,8.)
0.1010945632524705 #Msol / pc^3

We can also plot densities

>>> from galpy.potential import plotDensities
>>> plotDensities(MWPotential2014,rmin=0.1,zmax=0.25,zmin=-0.25,nrs=101,nzs=101)

which gives

.. image:: images/MWPotential-density.png

Another example of this is for an exponential disk potential

>>> from galpy.potential import DoubleExponentialDiskPotential
>>> dp= DoubleExponentialDiskPotential(hr=1./4.,hz=1./20.,normalize=1.)

The density computed using the Poisson equation now requires multiple
numerical integrations, so the agreement between the analytical
density and that computed using the Poisson equation is slightly less good, but still better than a percent

>>> (dp.dens(1.,0.,forcepoisson=True)-dp.dens(1.,0.))/dp.dens(1.,0.)
0.0032522956769123019

The density is

>>> dp.plotDensity(rmin=0.1,zmax=0.25,zmin=-0.25,nrs=101,nzs=101)

.. image:: images/dp-density.png

and the potential is

>>> dp.plot(rmin=0.1,zmin=-0.25,zmax=0.25)

.. image:: images/dp-potential.png

Clearly, the potential is much less flattened than the density.

Close-to-circular orbits and orbital frequencies
-------------------------------------------------

We can also compute the properties of close-to-circular orbits. First
of all, we can calculate the circular velocity and its derivative

>>> mp.vcirc(1.)
1.0
>>> mp.dvcircdR(1.)
-0.163777427566978

or, for lists of Potential instances

>>> from galpy.potential import vcirc
>>> vcirc(MWPotential2014,1.)
1.0
>>> from galpy.potential import dvcircdR
>>> dvcircdR(MWPotential2014,1.)
-0.10091361254334696

We can also calculate the various frequencies for close-to-circular
orbits. For example, the rotational frequency

>>> mp.omegac(0.8)
1.2784598203204887
>>> from galpy.potential import omegac
>>> omegac(MWPotential2014,0.8)
1.2733514576122869

and the epicycle frequency

>>> mp.epifreq(0.8)
1.7774973530267848
>>> from galpy.potential import epifreq
>>> epifreq(MWPotential2014,0.8)
1.7452189766287691

as well as the vertical frequency

>>> mp.verticalfreq(1.0)
3.7859388972001828
>>> from galpy.potential import verticalfreq
>>> verticalfreq(MWPotential2014,1.)
2.7255405754769875


For close-to-circular orbits, we can also compute the radii of the
Lindblad resonances. For example, for a frequency similar to that of
the Milky Way's bar

>>> mp.lindbladR(5./3.,m='corotation') #args are pattern speed and m of pattern
0.6027911166042229 #~ 5kpc
>>> print mp.lindbladR(5./3.,m=2)
None
>>> mp.lindbladR(5./3.,m=-2)
0.9906190683480501

The ``None`` here means that there is no inner Lindblad resonance, the
``m=-2`` resonance is in the Solar neighborhood (see the section on
the :ref:`Hercules stream <hercules>` in this documentation).


Using interpolations of potentials
-----------------------------------

``galpy`` contains a general ``Potential`` class ``interpRZPotential``
that can be used to generate interpolations of potentials that can be
used in their stead to speed up calculations when the calculation of
the original potential is computationally expensive (for example, for
the ``DoubleExponentialDiskPotential``). Full details on how to set
this up are given :ref:`here <interprz>`. Interpolated potentials can
be used anywhere that general three-dimensional galpy potentials can
be used. Some care must be taken with outside-the-interpolation-grid
evaluations for functions that use ``C`` to speed up computations.

Adding potentials to the galpy framework
-----------------------------------------

Potentials in galpy can be used in many places such as orbit
integration, distribution functions, or the calculation of
action-angle variables, and in most cases any instance of a potential
class that inherits from the general ``Potential`` class (or a list of
such instances) can be given. For example, all orbit integration
routines work with any list of instances of the general ``Potential``
class. Adding new potentials to galpy therefore allows them to be used
everywhere in galpy where general ``Potential`` instances can be
used. Adding a new class of potentials to galpy consists of the
following series of steps (some of these are also given in the file
``README.dev`` in the galpy distribution):

1. Implement the new potential in a class that inherits from ``galpy.potential.Potential``. The new class should have an ``__init__`` method that sets up the necessary parameters for the class. An amplitude parameter ``amp=`` should be taken as an argument for this class and before performing any other setup, the   ``galpy.potential.Potential.__init__(self,amp=amp)`` method should   be called to setup the amplitude. To add support for normalizing the   potential to standard galpy units, one can call the   ``galpy.potential.Potential.normalize`` function at the end of the __init__ function. 

  The new potential class should implement some of the following
  functions: 

  * ``_evaluate(self,R,z,phi=0,t=0)`` which evaluates the
    potential itself (*without* the amp factor, which is added in the
    ``__call__`` method of the general Potential class).

  * ``_Rforce(self,R,z,phi=0.,t=0.)`` which evaluates the radial force
    in cylindrical coordinates (-d potential / d R).

  * ``_zforce(self,R,z,phi=0.,t=0.)`` which evaluates the vertical force
    in cylindrical coordinates (-d potential / d z).

  * ``_R2deriv(self,R,z,phi=0.,t=0.)`` which evaluates the second
    (cylindrical) radial derivative of the potential (d^2 potential /
    d R^2).

  * ``_z2deriv(self,R,z,phi=0.,t=0.)`` which evaluates the second
    (cylindrical) vertical derivative of the potential (d^2 potential /
    d z^2).

  * ``_Rzderiv(self,R,z,phi=0.,t=0.)`` which evaluates the mixed
    (cylindrical) radial and vertical derivative of the potential (d^2
    potential / d R d z).

  * ``_dens(self,R,z,phi=0.,t=0.)`` which evaluates the density. If
    not given, the density is computed using the Poisson equation from
    the first and second derivatives of the potential (if all are
    implemented).

  * ``_mass(self,R,z=0.,t=0.)`` which evaluates the mass. For
    spherical potentials this should give the mass enclosed within the
    spherical radius; for axisymmetric potentials this should return
    the mass up to ``R`` and between ``-Z`` and ``Z``. If not given,
    the mass is computed by integrating the density (if it is
    implemented or can be calculated from the Poisson equation).

  * ``_phiforce(self,R,z,phi=0.,t=0.)``: the azimuthal force in
    cylindrical coordinates (assumed zero if not implemented).

  * ``_phi2deriv(self,R,z,phi=0.,t=0.)``: the second azimuthal
    derivative of the potential in cylindrical coordinates (d^2
    potential / d phi^2; assumed zero if not given).

  * ``_Rphideriv(self,R,z,phi=0.,t=0.)``: the mixed radial and
    azimuthal derivative of the potential in cylindrical coordinates
    (d^2 potential / d R d phi; assumed zero if not given).

  If you want to be able to calculate the concentration for a
  potential, you also have to set self._scale to a scale parameter for
  your potential.

  The code for ``galpy.potential.MiyamotoNagaiPotential`` gives a good
  template to follow for 3D axisymmetric potentials. Similarly, the
  code for ``galpy.potential.CosmphiDiskPotential`` provides a good
  template for 2D, non-axisymmetric potentials.

  After this step, the new potential will work in any part of galpy
  that uses pure python potentials. To get the potential to work with
  the C implementations of orbit integration or action-angle
  calculations, the potential also has to be implemented in C and the
  potential has to be passed from python to C.

  The ``__init__`` method should be written in such a way that a
  relevant object can be initialized using ``Classname()`` (i.e.,
  there have to be reasonable defaults given for all parameters,
  including the amplitude); doing this allows the nose tests for
  potentials to automatically check that your Potential's potential
  function, force functions, second derivatives, and density (through
  the Poisson equation) are correctly implemented (if they are
  implemented). The continuous-integration platform that builds the
  galpy codebase upon code pushes will then automatically test all of
  this, streamlining push requests of new potentials.

2. To add a C implementation of the potential, implement it in a .c file under ``potential_src/potential_c_ext``. Look at ``potential_src/potential_c_ext/LogarithmicHaloPotential.c`` for the right format for 3D, axisymmetric potentials, or at ``potential_src/potential_c_ext/LopsidedDiskPotential.c`` for 2D, non-axisymmetric potentials. 

 For orbit integration, the functions such as:

 * double LogarithmicHaloPotentialRforce(double R,double Z, double phi,double t,struct potentialArg * potentialArgs)
 * double LogarithmicHaloPotentialzforce(double R,double Z, double phi,double t,struct potentialArg * potentialArgs) 

 are most important. For some of the action-angle calculations

 * double LogarithmicHaloPotentialEval(double R,double Z, double phi,double t,struct potentialArg * potentialArgs)
 is most important (i.e., for those algorithms that evaluate the potential). The arguments of the potential are passed in a ``potentialArgs`` structure that contains ``args``, which are the arguments that should be unpacked. Again, looking at some example code will make this clear. The ``potentialArgs`` structure is defined in ``potential_src/potential_c_ext/galpy_potentials.h``.

3. Add the potential's function declarations to
``potential_src/potential_c_ext/galpy_potentials.h``

4. (4. and 5. for planar orbit integration) Edit the code under
``orbit_src/orbit_c_ext/integratePlanarOrbit.c`` to set up your new
potential (in the **parse_leapFuncArgs** function).

5. Edit the code in ``orbit_src/integratePlanarOrbit.py`` to set up your
new potential (in the **_parse_pot** function).

6. Edit the code under ``orbit_src/orbit_c_ext/integrateFullOrbit.c`` to
set up your new potential (in the **parse_leapFuncArgs_Full** function).

7. Edit the code in ``orbit_src/integrateFullOrbit.py`` to set up your
new potential (in the **_parse_pot** function).

8. (for using the actionAngleStaeckel methods in C) Edit the code in
``actionAngle_src/actionAngle_c_ext/actionAngle.c`` to parse the new
potential (in the **parse_actionAngleArgs** function).

9. Finally, add ``self.hasC= True`` to the initialization of the
potential in question (after the initialization of the super class, or
otherwise it will be undone). If you have implemented the necessary
second derivatives for integrating phase-space volumes, also add
``self.hasC_dxdv=True``.

After following the relevant steps, the new potential class can be
used in any galpy context in which C is used to speed up computations.
